# Blooket-All-Correct
Simple JS script to be executed in your browser's console, making every answer choice correct

## Usage

* Join a Blooket game at **https://play.blooket.com**, and wait for the game to start
* As menial as it might be, you will want to execute this only once the first question shows up, otherwise it will not work. (I have had some success with it working if executed before the first question loads, however I have had the best results when I waited for the first question to load then executing)
* Once you execute, you will need to answer the current question, and from then on out every question and answer will be the exact same, requiring you to just click any answer choice.
